# WalnutCreekClimateActionPlan

## Objective
Help Walnut Creek’s Climate Action Plan by isolating and analyzing relevant data about Walnut creek from California Distributed Generation Statistics, which houses information for all solar projects connected to the grid.

# Resources
https://www.californiadgstats.ca.gov/downloads/ has several datasets available for download

What to look at:

1.	Our analyst looks at trends of overall kW of installed solar and sometimes residential vs. commercial, but there’s much more in the dataset that could be analyzed. For example, look at trends over time for:
    a.	kW by customer sector over time
    b.	Walnut Creek zip codes and kW installed (by zip codes if possible) – is it increasing every year? Is one zip code lagging?
    c.	Who are the most common companies and do they change over time?
    d.	Average length of time between application received and complete application dates by customer sector, and has that gone down over time or stayed the same?
    e.	In tracking just kW and our permit counts, we hit a high in 2015, and it has been decreasing since then. 2017 was low. We’re interested to know more and see if other things changed at the same time that might give more context. There were some policy factors at the state/federal level impacting the solar industry that we might have felt locally. But maybe it was just one neighborhood or one customer sector that got hit.

2.	Find the City’s Climate Action Plan (written in 2012, and updated in 2016 – both links here) on this page: http://walnut-creek.org/departments/going-green-together/climate-change 

3.	Right now we only display this data statically through presentations and charts like those on the above webpage. Interested attendees could figure out a more real-time way to display this data and our progress to the community.
